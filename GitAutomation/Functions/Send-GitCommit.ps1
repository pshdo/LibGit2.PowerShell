function Send-GitCommit

    .SYNOPSIS
    Pushes commits from the current Git repository to its remote source repository.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Send-GitCommit` function sends all commits on the current branch of the local Git repository to its upstream remote repository. If you are pushing a new branch, use the `SetUpstream` switch to ensure Git tracks the new remote branch as a copy of the local branch.
    
    If the repository requires authentication, pass the username/password via the `Credential` parameter.

    Returns a `Git.Automation.PushResult` that represents the result of the push. One of:

    * `Ok`: the push succeeded
    * `Failed`: the push failed.
    * `Rejected`: the push failed because there are changes on the branch that aren't present in the local repository. They should get pulled into the local repository and the push attempted again.

    This function implements the `git push` command. 

    .EXAMPLE
    Send-GitCommit

    Pushes commits from the repository at the current location to its upstream remote repository

    .EXAMPLE
    Send-GitCommit -RepoRoot 'C:\Build\TestGitRepo' -Credential $PsCredential

    Pushes commits from the repository located at 'C:\Build\TestGitRepo' to its remote using authentication
