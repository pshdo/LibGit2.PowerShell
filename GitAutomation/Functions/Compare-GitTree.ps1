    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets a diff of the file tree changes in a repository between two commits.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Compare-GitTree` function returns a `LibGit2Sharp.TreeChanges` object representing the file tree changes in a repository between two commits. The tree changes are the names of the files that have been added, removed, modified, and renamed in a git repository.

    Pass the name of commits to diff, such as commit hash, branch name, or tag name, to the `ReferenceCommit` and `DifferenceCommit` parameters.

    You must specify a commit reference name for the `ReferenceCommit` parameter. The `DifferenceCommit` parameter is optional and defaults to `HEAD`.

    This function implements the `git diff --name-only` command.

    .EXAMPLE
    Compare-GitTree -ReferenceCommit 'HEAD^'

    Demonstrates how to get the diff between the default `HEAD` commit and its parent commit referenced by `HEAD^`.

    .EXAMPLE
    Compare-GitTree -RepoRoot 'C:\build\repo' -ReferenceCommit 'tags/1.0' -DifferenceCommit 'tags/2.0'

    Demonstrates how to get the diff between the commit tagged with `2.0` and the older commit tagged with `1.0` in the repository located at `C:\build\repo`.
