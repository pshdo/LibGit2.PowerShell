function Test-GitUncommittedChange

    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests for uncommitted changes in a git repository.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Test-GitUncommittedChange` function checks for any uncommited changes in a git repository.

    It defaults to the current repository and only the current branch. Use the `RepoRoot` parameter to specify an explicit path to another repo.

    Implements the `git diff --exit-code` command ( No output if no uncommitted changes, otherwise output diff )

    .EXAMPLE
    Test-GitUncommittedChange -RepoRoot 'C:\Projects\GitAutomation'

    Demonstrates how to check for uncommitted changes in a repository that isn't the current directory.
